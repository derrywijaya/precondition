\subsection{Data Construction}
We construct a dataset from Wikipedia revision histories of person entities whose facts change between the year 2007 and 2012 (i.e., have at least one fact in YAGO KB with a start or end time in this period). We obtain Wikipedia URLs of this set of entities $P$ from YAGO and crawl their revision histories%, obtaining any revision their pages have between the year 2007 and 2012
. Given a person $p$, his Wikipedia revision history $H_p$ has a set of ordered dates $T_p$ on which revisions are made to his Wikipedia page $W_p$ (we consider a date granularity for time). Each revision $W_{p, t_p} \in H_p$ is the content of $W_p$ at date $t_p$ where $t_p \in T_p$. 

A document $d_{p, t_p}$ in our data set is the \textit{difference} between any two consecutive revisions to $W_p$ that is separated by at least a single date worth of revisions i.e., $d_{p, t_p} = W_{p, t_p+2} - W_{p, t_p}$. Our dataset consists of all documents $d_{p, t_p}$ $\forall t_p \in T_p,\ t \in [01/01/2007,\ 12/31/2012]$, $\forall p \in P$. 

For example, Ralph McInerny's Wikipedia page was consecutively revised on the dates of 11/20/2012, 12/26/2012 and 12/29/2012. We find the difference between the last revision to his page on 11/20/2012 and the first revision to his page on 12/29/2012 (since a page can be revised multiple times in a date). This difference\footnote[2]{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ralph\_McInerny \&type=revision\&diff=530257160\&oldid=523980632}, a HTML page obtained by ``compare selected revisions"  functionality in Wikipedia, is a document in our dataset. Using this method, we obtain 288,184 documents from revision histories of 16,909 Wikipedia entities. 

From this dataset, we obtain documents that contain infobox changes. We define an infobox attribute of an entity e.g., \textsc{spouse} to \textit{begin} when a new value or a begin time is added to the attribute slot and to \textit{end} when an end time is being added to the slot. Using regular expression to detect whether a new value, a start, or an end time is being added to infobox slots of a document, we automatically label each document with ``begin-\{attribute\_name\}" or ``end-\{attribute\_name\}". So a document that contains an addition of a new value in the \textsc{spouse} slot will be labeled ``begin-spouse", while a document that contains an addition of end time in the \textsc{spouse} slot will be labeled ``end-spouse".
