\section{Method} \label{sec:method}

We construct a dataset from Wikipedia edit histories of person entities whose facts change between the year 2007 and 2012. We consider entities to have facts changed in this period whenever at least one of their facts in Timely YAGO KB \cite{wang2010timely} has begin/end time in this period. Using this method, we obtain Wikipedia URLs of 20,324 entities and crawl their Wikipedia revision histories, obtaining any revisions their Wikipedia pages have between the year 2007 and 2012. Each document in our data set is the \textit{difference} between any two revisions to an entity's Wikipedia page that are separated by at least a single day worth of revisions. For example, a Wikipedia entity ``Ralph McInerny" has his page revised on the days of 20 November 2012, 26 and 29 December 2012 consecutively. We find the difference between the first revision on 20 November 2012 and the last revision on 29 December 2012 (since a page can be revised multiple times in a day). This difference, a HTML page obtained by ``compare selected revisions"  functionality in Wikipedia, is a document in our dataset. By crawling Wikipedia revision histories, we obtain 288,184 documents this way\footnote[1]{We make our Wikipedia edit histories dataset available here: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~dwijaya/wiki-edits-dataset.zip}.
