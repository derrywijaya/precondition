\section{Method} \label{sec:method}

We construct a dataset from Wikipedia revision histories of person entities whose facts change between the year 2007 and 2012. We consider entities to have changed facts whenever at least one of their facts in YAGO KB \cite{wang2010timely} has begin/end time in this period. We obtain Wikipedia URLs of these entities from YAGO and crawl their Wikipedia revision histories, obtaining revisions their pages have between the year 2007 and 2012. Each document in our data set is the \textit{difference} between any two revisions to an entity's Wikipedia page that are separated by at least a single day worth of revisions. For example, a Wikipedia entity ``Ralph McInerny" page was consecutively revised on the days of 20 November 2012, 26 and 29 December 2012. We find the difference between the first revision to his page on 20 November 2012 and the last revision to his page on 29 December 2012 (since a page can be revised multiple times in a day). This difference\footnote[1]{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ralph\_McInerny \&type=revision\&diff=530257160\&oldid=523980632}, a HTML page obtained by ``compare selected revisions"  functionality in Wikipedia, is a document in our dataset. Using this method, we obtain 288,184 documents in our dataset from revision histories of 16,909 Wikipedia entities\footnote[2]{We make our Wikipedia edit histories dataset available here: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~dwijaya/wiki-edits-dataset.zip}. 

From this dataset, we obtain documents that contain infobox changes. We define an infobox attribute of an entity e.g., \textsc{spouse} to \textit{begin} when a new value or a begin time is added to the attribute slot and to \textit{end} when an end time is being added to the slot. Using regular expression to detect whether a new value, a start, or an end time is being added to infobox slots of a document, we automatically label each document with ``begin-\{attribute\_name\}" or ``end-\{attribute\_name\}". So a document that contains an addition of a new value in the \textsc{spouse} slot will be labeled ``begin-spouse", while a document that contains an addition of end time in the \textsc{spouse} slot will be labeled ``end-spouse".
