\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we presented a method that learns state changing verb phrases from Wikipedia revision history.
% learning about verbs and the state changes they bring about to KB facts. 
We first constructed and curated a novel dataset from Wikipedia revision history that is tailored to our task.  We showed that this dataset is useful for learning verb phrase features that are effective for predicting state changes in the knowledge base (KB), where we considered the KB to be infoboxes and their values. As future work we wish to explore the usefulness of  our verb resource to other KBs to improve KB freshness. This is important because existing KBs are mostly static.

Most Wikipedia revisions only have text change without associated infobox change. Another future work is to also learn from these unlabeled documents. In this paper, we learn the post-conditions of verbs: state changes that are true after the event expressed by the verbs happen. An interesting future work is to also explore whether it is also to learn pre-conditions of verbs from these Wikipedia revisions.%  use our generated resource    updating existing KBs, which are currently mostly static.
