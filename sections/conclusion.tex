\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we propose a method for learning about verbs and the state changes they bring about to KB facts. We construct a novel dataset from Wikipedia revision histories that is useful for learning about events, verbs and state changes. We observe in our experiments that learned verbs resource from this dataset is effective for predicting state changes in the knowledge base.
