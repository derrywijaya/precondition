\textbf{Learning from Wikipedia Edit History.}
Wikipedia edit history has been exploited in a number
of language understanding problems.
However, prior methods were targeted for various tasks different form ours.
  A popular task in this regard is that of
Wikipedia edit history categorization\cite{daxenberger2013automatically}.  This task
involves characterizing  a given change instance as one of many possible categories such as
such as spelling error correction, paraphrase or vandalism to edits in a document. 
\cite{DaxenbergerG12}  came up with a 21 category edit classification
taxonomy.  Other tasks to leverage Wikipedia edit history include:
 spelling error correction, summarization, preposition error
 correction, sentence compression, bias detection, and
 textual  entailment \cite{Nelken08miningwikipedia,Cahill13robustsystems,Zanzotto_expandingtextual,RecasensDJ13}.
These studies are concerned with coarse grained change type classification as opposed
to the establishing a specific correspondence between text changes, at a word level,  to  infobox changes.

\textbf{Learning State Changing Verbs.}
Very few works have studied the problem of detecting state changing verbs.
\cite{HosseiniHEK14} learned state changing verbs in the context of solving arithmetic word problems.
The learned the effect of the words such as add, subtract on the the current state. 
The VerbOcean resource was automatically generated from the Web\cite{Chklovski04}. The authors  studied the problem of fine-grained semantic relationships between verbs from Web document. They learn relations such as  if someone has bought an item, they may sell it at a later time. This then involves capturing empirical regularities  if ``X buys Y'' happens before ``X
sells Y'', for the same X and Y values in a given context. Unlike the work we present here, the methods of \cite{Chklovski04,HosseiniHEK14}  do not make a connection to knowledge base relations such as Wikipedia infoboxes.
In a vision paper, \cite{Wijaya2014akbc} give high level descriptions of  a number of possible methods for learning state changing methods but did not implement any of them.
