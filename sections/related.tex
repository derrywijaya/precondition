\textbf{Learning from Wikipedia Revision History.}
Wikipedia edit history has been exploited in a number of problems.
%Prior methods target various tasks different from ours.
  A popular task in this regard is that of
Wikipedia edit history categorization\cite{daxenberger2013automatically}.  This task
involves characterizing  a given edit instance as one of many possible categories 
such as spelling error correction, paraphrasing, vandalism,  and textual entailment. \cite{Nelken08miningwikipedia,Cahill13robustsystems,Zanzotto_expandingtextual,RecasensDJ13}.. 
%\cite{DaxenbergerG12}  came up with a 21 category edit classification
%taxonomy.  Other tasks to leverage Wikipedia edit history include: sentence compression, bias detection, and
% textual  entailment \cite{Nelken08miningwikipedia,Cahill13robustsystems,Zanzotto_expandingtextual,RecasensDJ13}.
Prior methods target various tasks different from ours.
% In particular, they are concerned with coarse grained change type classification as opposed
%to  establishing a verb-level  correspondence between text changes and  infobox changes.

\textbf{Learning State Changing Verbs.}
Very few works have studied the problem of learning state changing verbs.
\cite{HosseiniHEK14} learned state changing verbs in the context of solving arithmetic word problems.
They learned the effect of  words such as \textit{add, subtract} on  the current state. 
The VerbOcean resource was automatically generated from the Web\cite{Chklovski04}. The authors  studied the problem of fine-grained semantic relationships between verbs. They learn relations such as  if someone has bought an item, they may sell it at a later time. This then involves capturing empirical regularities such as  ``X buys Y'' happens before ``X
sells Y''. Unlike the work we present here, the methods of \cite{Chklovski04,HosseiniHEK14}  do not make a connection to KB relations such as Wikipedia infoboxes.
In a vision paper, \cite{Wijaya2014akbc} give high level descriptions of  a number of possible methods for learning state changing methods. They  did not implement any of them.
