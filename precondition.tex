\begin{abstract}
%Ndapa: this abstact intro is a bit stale and over used as we have used it in 
% the other papers, I have changed it a bit and also made the abstract shorter.
% it is better to keep the abstract short and give more motivation in the intro

%Knowledge bases (KBs) %that have emerged 
%that have emerged in recent years  are mostly static. They contain facts about the world yet are seldom updated. This paper proposes a %method for learning state changes brought about by verbs acting on their arguments (i.e., entities).
% State changes are viewed as updates of KB facts pertaining to the entities. 

Learning to determine when the facts of a Knowledge Base (KB) have to be updated is a challenging task.
We propose to learn state changing verbs from Wikipedia revision history. When a state-changing even,  such as a marriage or death,  happens to an entity, the  infobox on the entity's Wikipedia page may be updated. At the same time, the text the same article may be updated with verbs either being added or deleted to reflect the new state of the real world entity. We use Wikipedia revision history %histories 
to distantly supervise a method for automatically learning verbs and state changes. Additionally, our method uses %fact-specific 
constraints
 %such as mutually exclusivisity vs. simultaneous changes of infobox slots
  to effectively map verbs to infobox changes. We observe in our experiments that when state-changing verbs are  added or deleted from an entity's Wikipedia  page text, we can update the entity's infobox with 88\% precision and 76\% recall.
One immediate  application of our verbs is to incorporate as triggers in methods for   updating existing KBs, which are currently mostly static.
